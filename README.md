## The Main Script
[PyCity Schools Analysis](https://github.com/XueXuanXu/04-pandas-challenge/blob/master/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb)
>This script reads the *school_complete.csv* file and the *students_complete.csv* file, then does a few summaries based on the data in those files.

## The Written Summary

From the *spending_summary* table, I see that as the average spending ranges per student increase, the average math score, average reading score, math passing rate, reading passing rate, and overall passing rate slightly decrease.

From the *size_summary* table, I see that as the school size reaches 2000 and above, all the scores and passing rates decrease.
