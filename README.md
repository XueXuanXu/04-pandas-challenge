## The Written Summary

From the *spending_summary* table, I see that as the average spending ranges per student increases, both the average math score, average reading score, math passing rate, reading passing rate, and overall passing rate have a slightly decrease.

From the *size_summary* table, I see that as the school size reaches 2000 and above, all the scores and passing rates decrease.
